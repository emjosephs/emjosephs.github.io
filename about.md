I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto, where I am coadvised by [John Stinchcombe](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/stinchcombe/) and [Stephen Wright](http://wright.eeb.utoronto.ca/).

I have a bachelor's degree in biology from Brown University, where I worked in Annie Schmitt's lab and did an honors thesis studying natural variation in germination response to cold in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. After graduation, I worked as a research associate in [Leonie Moyle's](http://www.indiana.edu/~moylelab/) lab at Indiana University and as a field intern on a [large guppy experimental evolution project](http://cnas.ucr.edu/guppy/) in Trinidad.

I've also gotten to go on a few non-science-related adventures, like biking from Boston to Santa Barbara to raise money for affordable housing with [Bike & Build](bikeandbuild.org)
