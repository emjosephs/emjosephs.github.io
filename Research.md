# Maintenance of variation

What evolutionary processes maintain phenotypic variation within populations? How much of this variation is adaptive and how much is the result of a balance between mutation and purifying selection?

I am working to characterize genetic and phenotypic variation within a natural population of *Capsella grandiflora*. To do this I am collaborating with Young Wha Lee on genome-wide association mapping study which will attempt to connect genetic sequence, gene expression levels, and physical traits. My goals are not only to find the genetic variants which affect phenotypic variation, but also to describe how selection acts on these variants. To do this, I'm using gene expression as a model phenotype and focussing on local genetic variants that affect expression.

# Population genomics of *Capsella grandiflora*

What role does selection play in shaping genomic variation? I collaborated with Robert Williamson to explore this in a sample of 13 *C. grandiflora* individuals collected from across the species range. In particular, I examined whether positive selection has significantly contributed to divergence between *C. grandiflora* and its close relatives by looking for reduced diversity around replacement substitutions, as would be expected if selective sweeps have been common. I also tested for variation in the strength of selection between genes with different expression levels. You can read more about this work [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004622) . We also collaborated with Ramesh Arunkumar to measure selection on pollen-expressed genes and this work is described [here](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=23997108).


# My research system

*Capsella grandiflora* is a small weedy annual native to northern Greece and Albania. It's an obligate outcrosser and a member of the Brassicaceae family. It often gets mistaken for Arabidopsis, but, unlike Arabidopsis, it has heart-shaped fruit and somewhat larger flowers.

The population I'm working on is located on a trail head near the Greek town of Monodendri.
